### Installation and Use

#### *
The Main branch relies on the paid OpenAI API to work. This has been resolved (not released yet‚ùó) by implementing LlamaCpp for locally hosted Langchain agents instead.
For setup refer to the main [repo](https://docs.shortgpt.ai/docs/how-to-install) and installation [guide](https://docs.shortgpt.ai/docs/how-to-install)
### Upgrades
- access YouTube as provider of video assets, surpassing stock footage by large
- avoids bans by using download streams with PyTube
- avoids YouTube v3 API's rate limit and auth
- avoids Pexels hard rate limit 

### Features 


Inside `api_utils` functions provide utility for working with different APIs. Files: `image_api.py`, `pexels_api.py`,  `youtube_api.py` and `eleven_api.py`. We added  `youtube_api.py` to source video assets directly from YouTube. Feel free to modify `the _generateVideoUrls` function for the hierachy of video asset sources. 

-  #### `search_videos_YouTube(query_string)`
  
      The search_videos_YouTube function takes a query string as input and searches for a video on YouTube based on that query. It returns the URL of the first search result if found, or None if no video is found.
      
      Integration of `shortGPT.api_utils.youtube_api`, which serves as an additional source for gathering footage based on the queried keyword. This is particularly useful when dealing with niche / comedy / meme topics where stock footage is not available. If nothing matches we backtrack to the pexels API. 

-  #### `triage_videos_Youtube(expected_score_parameter)` ‚ùónot released yet

### Demo

demo_new shows the accuracy of the newly added youtube query policy ***without*** further guidance, backtesting or content analysis. This can be improved by adding a content triage based on Clip2 and transcript analysis.
