- 🎥 The `ContentVideoEngine` is ideal for longer videos, taking care of tasks like generating audio, automatically sourcing background video footage, timing captions, and preparing background assets.

- 🗣️ The `ContentTranslationEngine` is designed to dub and translate entire videos, from mainstream languages to more specific target languages. It takes a video file, or youtube link, transcribe it's audio, translates the content, voices it in a target language, adds captions , and gives back a new video, in a totally different language.
