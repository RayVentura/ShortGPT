# Instructions for running shortGPT

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing ImageMagick and FFmpeg on your system, which are both required to do automated editing. Once installed, you can proceed to run `runShortGPT.py` successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Installation Steps

Follow the instructions below to install ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and clone the shortGPT repository:

### Step 1: Install ImageMagick

1. For `Windows` download the installer from the official ImageMagick website and follow the installation instructions.
      
      [https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
      
     
2. For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install imagemagick
     ```
     Then run the following command to fix a moviepy Imagemagick policy.xml incompatibility problem:
     ```
     !sed -i '/<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@\*"/d' /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
     ```    
4. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:
     ```
     brew install imagemagick
     ```
     

2. Verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```
   convert --version
   ```

   You should see the ImageMagick version information if the installation was successful.

### Step 2: Install FFmpeg (REQUIRED FOR SHORTGPT TO WORK)

1. For `Windows`Download the FFmpeg binaries from this Windows Installer (It will download ffmpeg, ffprobe and add it to your path).
      
      [https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306](https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306)
      
2. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:
     ```
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```   
    For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
     ```
2. Verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

   You should see the FFmpeg version information if the installation was successful.

### Step 3: Clone the shortGPT Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Execute the following command to clone the shortGPT repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rayventura/shortgpt.git
   ```

### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `runShortGPT.py` is located (the cloned repo).
3. Execute the following command to install the required Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install the necessary packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running runShortGPT.py Web Interface

Once you have successfully installed ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and the Python dependencies, you can run `runShortGPT.py` by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `runShortGPT.py` is located (the cloned repo).
3. Execute the following command to run the script:
   ```
   python runShortGPT.py
   ```
4. After running the script, a Gradio interface should open at your local host on port 31415 (http://localhost:31415). 

## Putting API Keys
The ShortGPT UI needs you to input at least OpenAI and ElevenLabs api keys for running short automations. For video automations, you will also need to add a Pexels API.

Follow these steps to add your OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys:

1. Open [http://localhost:31415/?__theme=light](http://localhost:31415/?__theme=light) from a web browser. 
2. Click on the `config` tab located at the left side bar of the user interface.
3. Add your `OPENAI API KEY` and `ELEVENLABS API KEY` in the corresponding input fields.
4. Click `Save` to save your API keys.

That's it! You have successfully set up your API keys and can now utilize the functionality of ShortGPT in the Gradio interface.
